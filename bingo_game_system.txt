discard static bingo card and reddit format, change to lobby-ish game format
the way in which people consume bingo cards and the rate of their creation prob doesn't fit a forum post format
bingo card tiles are no longer going to be static, instead they become a pool from which visitors are given a randomly generated card from said pool
bingo completion results are tracked to see which tiles are the most popular, to see which "trope" of a subject is the most correct/true

things that go towards anti-results spoofing:
    1. weighing results from logged in users higher, and using some other metric to weigh users against another
    2. session tracking to only count the first result
    3. some sort of mild obfuscation to prevent spoofers from being able to reverse engineer system
    4. prob not that serious anyway, spoofing results is pretty inconsequential since its contained to one card and to the existing tiles

not sure how to format a home page in a way that's relevant
bingo card meme templates are kind of big, so idk how to make them digestible
possibly just show a random amount of tiles as a highlight and state that its random
or just show the top N tiles for less work

would also like to have card link embeds to show the entire bingo card
but idk how to do that either with the current way the site is set up
